# LLM Comparative Analysis Application

## Phase 1: Core UI and Initial Response Generation ✅
- [x] Create main layout with Material Design 3 styling (header, input area, side-by-side response panels)
- [x] Implement primary prompt input field with submit button
- [x] Build response display components for OpenAI and Claude (side-by-side cards with elevation)
- [x] Add mode selector toggle (Manual vs Automated)
- [x] Integrate OpenAI API for initial response generation
- [x] Integrate Anthropic Claude API for initial response generation
- [x] Display both initial responses simultaneously in the UI

---

## Phase 2: Manual Cross-Evaluation Mode ✅
- [x] Implement 'Iterate' button that triggers manual cross-evaluation
- [x] Create event handler that sends previous responses cross-wise to both APIs
- [x] Update UI to show iteration history with clear versioning (Iteration 1, 2, 3...)
- [x] Display refined responses from both models after each manual iteration
- [x] Add visual indicators showing which iteration is currently displayed

---

## Phase 3: Automated Agentic Cross-Evaluation Mode ✅
- [x] Implement automated cycling logic that runs without user intervention
- [x] Create convergence detection using cosine similarity (95% threshold)
- [x] Add maximum iteration limit (10 iterations)
- [x] Display real-time iteration progress and similarity scores
- [x] Clearly mark final converged responses when criteria met
- [x] Add stop/pause controls for the automated mode
- [x] Show convergence metrics and final similarity percentage
